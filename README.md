WG's Nuvex is the **ultimate multi-layer storage solution for Node.js developers** - a lightweight, battle-tested SDK specifically engineered for Discord bots, Telegram bots, web servers, APIs, and server-side applications. Born from real-world development challenges and proven in production environments, Nuvex delivers enterprise-grade storage with zero complexity, intelligent data tier management, and **comprehensive TypeScript support**.

**The first multi-layer storage SDK with built-in intelligent caching and comprehensive Redis/PostgreSQL integration.** Stop wrestling with complex storage configurations and start building amazing applications efficiently. Whether you're creating the next viral Discord community bot, building high-performance APIs, developing microservices, or deploying production servers, Nuvex provides intelligent three-tier storage with automatic data promotion/demotion, seamless fallback mechanisms, and built-in performance monitoring that scales with your application's growth - from your first "Hello World" to handling millions of requests across distributed systems.

## ‚ù£Ô∏è Motivation

Modern bots and APIs need fast, reliable, and scalable storage. Traditional solutions force you to choose between speed (caching) and reliability (databases), making development complex and error-prone.

**Nuvex solves this by providing a unified, intelligent storage layer that combines caching and persistence‚Äîout of the box.** No more manual cache management or worrying about data loss. Just simple, efficient storage for all your Node.js applications.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üóÑÔ∏è Multi-layer Architecture**: Three-tier intelligent storage system with **Memory Cache (24hr TTL)**, **Redis Cache (3-day TTL)**, and **PostgreSQL (permanent)** - the first SDK with comprehensive automated data tier management.
- **‚ö° High Performance Storage**: Sub-millisecond access for frequently used data with intelligent promotion and demotion based on access patterns.
- **üîÑ Intelligent Fallback**: Graceful degradation when storage layers are unavailable - automatic layer switching with zero downtime.
- **üìä Built-in Metrics & Monitoring**: Comprehensive cache hit rates, performance analytics, and health monitoring with real-time insights.
- **üîå Pluggable Logging Integration**: Optimized for [@wgtechlabs/log-engine](https://github.com/wgtechlabs/log-engine) with support for any logger - structured logging that just works.
- **üí™ TypeScript First**: Full type safety with comprehensive interfaces and excellent developer experience across all storage operations.
- **üõ°Ô∏è Production Ready**: Connection pooling, automatic error recovery, health checks, and enterprise-grade reliability features.
- **üöÄ Zero Configuration**: Intelligent defaults that work out of the box - just connect and start storing data efficiently.
- **üéØ Smart Data Management**: Automatic data tier optimization based on access frequency and patterns - hot data stays fast, cold data stays persistent.
- **üîó Seamless Integration**: Simple API that works seamlessly with existing Node.js applications - Discord bots, APIs, web servers, and microservices.
- **‚öôÔ∏è Auto-Layer Selection**: Intelligent storage layer selection based on data type, size, and access patterns - no manual configuration required.
- **üìà Scalable Architecture**: Designed to scale from small applications to enterprise-level systems handling millions of operations.

## ü§î How It Works
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD051 -->
1. Nuvex automatically initializes your three-tier storage architecture with intelligent defaults optimized for your environment
2. When you store data, Nuvex intelligently selects the optimal storage layer based on data size, type, and access patterns
3. Each data retrieval checks layers in order: **Memory ‚Üí Redis ‚Üí PostgreSQL**, providing sub-millisecond to millisecond response times
4. Frequently accessed data is automatically promoted to faster layers, while unused data gracefully demotes to persistent storage
5. Built-in health monitoring continuously tracks layer availability and automatically handles failover with zero downtime
6. Performance metrics are collected in real-time, providing insights into cache hit rates, response times, and layer utilization

    url: 'redis://localhost:6379'
  }
});

// Connect to storage layers
await storage.connect();

// Store data (automatically chooses optimal layer)
await storage.set('user:123', { 
  name: 'John', 
  email: 'john@example.com',
  preferences: { theme: 'dark' }
});

// Retrieve data (checks layers in order: Memory ‚Üí Redis ‚Üí PostgreSQL)
const user = await storage.get('user:123');

// Set with custom TTL and layer preferences
await storage.set('session:abc', sessionData, { 
  ttl: 3600,
  layer: 'redis' // Force specific layer
});

// Batch operations for high performance
await storage.setBatch([
  { operation: 'set', key: 'key1', value: 'value1' },
  { operation: 'set', key: 'key2', value: 'value2' }
]);
```

### Configuration Options

#### Basic Configuration

```typescript
const config = {
  postgres: {
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 5432,
    database: 'myapp',
    user: 'postgres',
    password: 'password'
  },
  redis: {
    url: 'redis://localhost:6379',
    ttl: 259200 // 3 days
  },
  memory: {
    ttl: 86400000, // 24 hours in milliseconds
    maxSize: 10000 // Maximum entries
  }
};
};
```

#### Logging Integration

##### Enhanced Logging with @wgtechlabs/log-engine

[`@wgtechlabs/log-engine`](https://github.com/wgtechlabs/log-engine) is specifically designed to work seamlessly with Nuvex:

```typescript
import { LogEngine } from '@wgtechlabs/log-engine';
import { Nuvex } from 'nuvex';

// Configure log-engine
LogEngine.configure({
  level: 'info',
  service: 'nuvex-app',
  version: '1.0.0',
  environment: 'production'
});

const storage = new Nuvex({
  postgres: { /* ... */ },
  redis: { /* ... */ },
  logging: {
    enabled: true,
    logger: LogEngine,
    level: 'info',
    includeMetrics: true,
    includePerformance: true
  }
});
```

#### Alternative Loggers

Nuvex supports any logger that implements the simple interface:

```typescript
// With Winston
import winston from 'winston';
const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: 'info',
  format: winston.format.json(),
  transports: [new winston.transports.Console()]
});

// With Pino  
import pino from 'pino';
const logger = pino({ level: 'info' });

// With Console (development)
const logger = console;

// Use any logger
const storage = new Nuvex({
  postgres: { /* ... */ },
  logging: { enabled: true, logger }
});
```

## Logging

Nuvex supports pluggable logging with any logger that implements the simple interface.

### üî• Recommended: @wgtechlabs/log-engine

### PostgreSQL (Layer 3)

- **TTL**: Permanent storage
- **Use case**: Cold data, critical information
- **Performance**: 5-50ms access time

## Migration Guide

### From Bot-Specific Storage

If you're migrating from a bot-specific implementation:

```typescript
// Old bot-specific way
await botsStore.storeTicket(ticketData);
await botsStore.getUserState(userId);

// New generic way
await storage.set(`ticket:${ticketId}`, ticketData);
await storage.get(`user:${userId}:state`);
```

## Performance

Nuvex is designed for high-performance applications:

- **Memory Cache**: Sub-millisecond access for hot data
- **Intelligent Caching**: Automatic promotion of frequently accessed data
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimized database connections
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient bulk data operations

## Error Handling

Nuvex provides graceful error handling and fallback mechanisms:

```typescript
try {
  await storage.set('key', 'value');
} catch (error) {
  // Nuvex automatically falls back to available layers
  console.log('Storage operation failed:', error);
}
```

## Health Monitoring

```typescript
const health = await storage.healthCheck();
// Returns: { memory: true, redis: true, postgres: true, overall: true }

const metrics = storage.getMetrics();
// Returns: { memoryHits: 150, redisHits: 45, postgresHits: 12, ... }
```
